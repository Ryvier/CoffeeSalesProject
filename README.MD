Excel Dashboard using Large Data, Pivot Table, Timeline, Slicer

In this Excel-based coffee sales forecasting project, I've leveraged the power of PivotTables, a dynamic Timeline feature, and slicers to create an efficient and user-friendly sales analysis tool.

- PivotTable for Sales Forecasting:
I've implemented a PivotTable to provide a comprehensive sales forecast. By summarizing the data based on various factors such as date and product, the PivotTable offers a clear and detailed view of sales trends, enabling informed decision-making.

- Adjustable Timeline for Monthly and Yearly Insights:
To enhance the project's flexibility, I've incorporated a dynamic Timeline feature. This Timeline allows users to easily adjust their focus between monthly and yearly sales data, providing a granular or high-level perspective as needed. It simplifies the exploration of sales trends over time.

- Product Slicer for Data Filtering:
To manage large datasets efficiently, I've integrated a slicer that empowers users to filter and explore specific product categories. This feature streamlines data analysis by allowing users to narrow down their focus to relevant products, enhancing the overall usability of the tool.

- In summary, this Excel coffee sales project combines PivotTables, an adjustable Timeline, and a product slicer to deliver a comprehensive and user-centric approach to sales forecasting and data analysis. It provides the means to make data-driven decisions effectively and navigate through extensive sales data with ease.
